        <p>I'm an interactive digital media designer, I'm an artist and digital humanities scholar. I've created for myself a path that covers a wide range of abilities and perspectives 
            with the hopes of bringing it all together for collective social reckoning and the development of equitable and sustainable media.
            <br>
            <br>
            I consider emerging media and technology a prime space for democratizing public life, allowing everyone to show up in the ways they deem fitting. 
            At the same time, it is easily manipulated to intentionally leave some out of the picture, be it through accessibility or misinformation, 
            and we are racing ahead into a system that is quickly spiraling away from the human-centered goals it originally had.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my scholarship of not only media archaeology but also the affordances of technological infrastructure of both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 platforms, 
            I am able to bring the human back into human-centered design, to develop spaces that are not just accessible but welcoming to all.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having started out in the strategy side of public relations and advertising, the hours of research into consumer behavior 
            led to a greater interest in consumer conditioning and as one who is not immune to the numerous codes and signals embedded in 
            both traditional and digital media, I felt compelled to investigate further and illuminate these issues with the hopes of improving 
            the public's media literacy skills. My writings and installations have won me departmental awards, one of which is archived in the Spencer 
            Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, laying the groundwork for the topics I engaged with more recently in my master's program.
            <br>
            <br>
            Continuing my education in both the technical and critical side of digital media is just the beginning, as I hope to continue to 
            bring my acquired skills and theoretical insight into human-centered design. I have worked on projects requiring ui/ux principles and 
            accessibility compliance, interactive narrative development, a c++ variant for sensor technology development and many more. These are 
            the skills that will make up the backbone of the digital future and I intend to bring them together for the best possible outcome...
